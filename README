For all you SMP server hosts on linux, here is a way to generate map images
suitable for cronjobs or whatever. It's very rough currently and a bit slower
than Cartograph. Currently the only rendering mode is a straight top-down view
("overhead") still pretty rough but faster than it was and with oblique and
only-certain-blocks rendering modes. Usage is:

./pynemap.py: [options] path/to/world/level.dat
    General Options:
        -o|--output-file <filename>
            The filename of the resulting image. Should end with ".png"
            default: map.png
        -r|--render-mode <['blocks', 'oblique', 'overhead']>
            The method for rendering the map image, currently only supports "overview"
            default: overview
        -v|--verbose
            Output progress and other messages
            default: off (quiet)
        --keep-chunks
            Keep chunks in loaded in memory, can use *a lot* of memory for large maps
            default: load chunks one at a time during render
        --use-alpha
            *NYI* Use transparency for nicer looking maps
            default: no alpha channel
    Render Options:
        *blocks*:
            --only-blocks <block[,block[,block]]>
                Comma separated list of (dec) block ids to render
            --overlayed
                *NYI* Overlay onto overhead map


Note that it requires having the Python Imaging Library (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
(probably installed by default on most distros) and progressbar package
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar/) installed already.

Thanks to Cartograph for the block colors and tWoolie for the NBT parser (viewtopic.php?f=25&t=24585)!

Current release version:

Code: Select all
    git clone git://github.com/aheadley/pynemap.git
    cd pynemap
    git checkout release-0.1b2


Bleeding edge version:

Code: Select all
    git clone git://github.com/aheadley/pynemap.git

Apparently works on Windows and OS X. I try to keep compatibility with different
OSs and Python2.4 but no promises.
